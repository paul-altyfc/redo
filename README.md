# RedoMenu

Northcoders is opening its very own restaurant! And it needs you to help sort out its menu.

**This function will take 3 arguments:**

- a menu array,
- a chef string,
- a dietary requirement string

This kata will transform the array of menu objects with a variety of changes and additions.

**Each menu item must:**

- Have its course key renamed to recommended_course
- Have its id value be a number not a string
- Add a chef property whose value is the chef passed to the function
- Add a variable dietary requirement property whose value is true. The key should vary based on the dietary_requirement argument passed to the function.
- The rest of the menu information such as dish or special keys must be preserved.

Refer to the data.md file for examples to build up your test suite.
